            <h2>Step into the Dark History of the Nazgûl</h2>
            <p>The Nine Ringwraiths, once mighty kings, are now bound to Sauron’s will, transformed into spectral beings
                by the corruption of their Rings. <strong>Shadows of the Nine</strong> uncovers their origins, revealing
                how these men succumbed to the lure of power and became the most feared servants of the Dark Lord.</p>

                <p>The Witch-king, once a mortal king, became the leader of the Nazgûl after succumbing to the power of
                    one of the Nine Rings. He ruled over Angmar with fear and dark magic, relentlessly attacking the
                    northern kingdom of Arnor. His legacy of terror was sealed during the Siege of Minas Tirith.</p>

                <p>Khamûl, the second most powerful of the Nazgûl, was an Easterling chieftain who became Sauron’s most
                    loyal servant. Known for his command over Dol Guldur, he relentlessly hunted for the One Ring in the
                    North. Though weakened by daylight, his terror and cunning made him a formidable force.</p>
