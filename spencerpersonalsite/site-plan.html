    <h3>The Witch King of Angmar</h3>
    <p>Once a mortal king, the Witch-king of Angmar accepted one of Sauron’s Nine Rings of Power, succumbing over time
      to its dark influence. With his mortal identity erased and his will bound to Sauron’s, he became the leader of the
      Nazgûl. Known for his cruelty and strength, he was given dominion over the land of Angmar in the north, a kingdom
      he ruled with fear and dark magic, seeking to weaken and ultimately destroy the northern kingdom of Arnor.

      Master of Angmar and Harbinger of Destruction
      From his fortress of Carn Dûm, the Witch-king led countless attacks on Arnor, spreading terror and chaos in an
      attempt to fracture the Free Peoples. His relentless assault on the North became legendary and almost led to the
      complete annihilation of Arnor. Though his kingdom eventually fell, his reign solidified his reputation as the
      most feared of the Ringwraiths and Sauron’s most loyal servant.

      Unmatched Power and Abilities
      As the Lord of the Nazgûl, the Witch-king possessed unique powers that set him apart from the others. He wielded a
      cursed weapon, the Morgul blade, capable of inflicting a dark poison that could turn his victims into wraiths. His
      ability to inspire fear, even without being seen, was unparalleled, and he was immune to ordinary weapons.
      According to prophecy, no "man" could kill him, a detail that would shape his fate during the War of the Ring.

      Key Moments: The Siege of Minas Tirith
      During the War of the Ring, the Witch-king led Sauron’s armies in a siege against the city of Minas Tirith, the
      capital of Gondor. His dark sorcery and battle prowess were on full display as he broke through the gates of the
      city, striking fear into the hearts of Gondor’s defenders. However, his prophesied doom came when he faced Éowyn
      of Rohan and Merry the hobbit, who together fulfilled the prophecy, bringing about his fall on the Pelennor
      Fields.

      Symbol of Fear and Sauron’s Authority
      As the leader of the Nine, the Witch-king embodied Sauron’s authority and the power of the Rings. His story serves
      as a grim reminder of the corruption that follows the pursuit of unchecked power, as he became a wraith with no
      will of his own, existing only to carry out Sauron’s commands. His legacy of terror influenced Middle-earth’s
      history for centuries, leaving a mark on all who heard of his name.

      The Tragic Fate of a Lost King
      The Witch-king’s journey from a mortal ruler to a wraith bound in servitude is one of Middle-earth’s most tragic
      tales. His complete loss of identity, purpose, and freedom under Sauron’s control highlights the peril of
      ambitions without morality. The Witch-king’s fate serves as both a cautionary tale and a dark legend, forever
      enshrined as the most feared and destructive of the Nine.

    <h3>The Eastern Shadow: Khamûl and the Nine</h3>
    <p>
      Introduction to Khamûl
      Khamûl, known as the Shadow of the East, was the second most powerful of the Nazgûl, surpassed only by the
      Witch-king of Angmar. Originally an Easterling chieftain, Khamûl’s desire for power and influence led him to
      accept one of the Nine Rings from Sauron. Under the Ring’s corrupting influence, he fell into darkness, eventually
      becoming one of Sauron’s most loyal servants, known for his relentless obedience and ruthless pursuit of Sauron’s
      enemies.

      Khamûl’s Role Among the Nazgûl
      As the second-in-command, Khamûl was given considerable responsibilities by Sauron. He ruled over Dol Guldur in
      Mirkwood, where he kept watch over the surrounding lands and hunted for the One Ring. His powerful,
      terror-inducing presence made him one of the most feared of the Nine, though he was particularly vulnerable to
      sunlight, which weakened his abilities. His command over Dol Guldur helped solidify Sauron’s influence in the
      northern lands and spread fear among the free peoples.

      Powers and Abilities
      Like all Ringwraiths, Khamûl possessed enhanced senses, particularly the ability to detect the presence of the One
      Ring. However, he was also distinctively weaker in daylight, limiting his strength and effectiveness during the
      daytime. His leadership at Dol Guldur exemplified his cunning and cruelty, commanding an army of orcs and other
      dark creatures to maintain Sauron’s presence in the North.

      The Ringwraiths: A Collective Legacy of Terror
      Khamûl and his fellow Nazgûl embodied the corruption of power and the downfall of great leaders who succumbed to
      Sauron’s influence. Each Ringwraith was once a king or chieftain, gifted with one of the Nine Rings. Over time,
      they lost their identities, becoming wraiths bound entirely to Sauron’s will. Though they were fearsome in battle
      and nearly invincible, their loyalty came at the cost of their humanity, transforming them into shadows of their
      former selves.

      The Hunt for the One Ring
      Khamûl was among the Ringwraiths sent by Sauron to track down the One Ring, and he relentlessly pursued Frodo in
      the Shire and beyond. His close brush with Frodo in the Shire demonstrated his intense sensitivity to the Ring’s
      presence, making him a significant threat throughout Frodo’s journey. The Ringwraiths’ single-minded pursuit of
      the Ring showcased their utter devotion to Sauron, acting as his primary agents in the War of the Ring.

      Legacy and Influence
      Though ultimately defeated alongside the Witch-king, Khamûl’s legacy endures as a reminder of the power of
      corruption and the devastating effect of Sauron’s influence on once-great leaders. His story, along with that of
      the other Nazgûl, symbolizes the enduring danger of ambition unchecked by wisdom or morality. Their transformation
      into wraiths reflects the tragedy of individuals who forsake their humanity for power, and the haunting legacy of
      their actions continues to echo through Middle-earth.
